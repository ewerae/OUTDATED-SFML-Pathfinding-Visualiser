# Pathfinding-Visualiser
Serving as a placeholder and a record of my pathfinding application on SFML linux.

So far, added simple UI and an algorithm that finds the goal from start, based on if x and y are the same etc.

Still working on this, and will add proper algorithms to showcase, aswell as obstacles.
