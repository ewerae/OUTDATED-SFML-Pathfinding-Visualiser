# Pathfinding-Visualiser
![](https://github.com/ewerae/Pathfinding-Visualiser/blob/main/pathfinder.gif)
Serving as a placeholder and a record of my pathfinding application on SFML linux.

So far, added simple UI and an algorithm that finds the goal from start, based on if x and y are the same etc.

Still working on this, and will add proper algorithms to showcase, aswell as obstacles.
