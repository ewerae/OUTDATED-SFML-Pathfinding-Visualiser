# Pathfinding-Visualiser
Serving as a placeholder and a record of my pathfinding application on SFML linux.

Added A* search algorithm.

small minor things added:
- run and reset
- can override whatever state the tile has with another tile, no constant resetting or deleting certain tiles

Still working on this, and will add proper algorithms to showcase.
